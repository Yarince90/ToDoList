# ToDoList
This is a To Do list app that uses mongoodb as a local database to store items to a list of things to do and uses the mongoose framework to implement functionality from the server.
At this time it has the ability to create custom made To-Do lists by typing the desired list name at the end of the address bar as shown in the images below.
Upon creating a new list it loads 3 basic items for testing on each dynamically created list and has the ability to add or remove items from each list by clicking the checkbox beside each item.
At a later date I am planning on adding a button to create custom lists in the UI as well as changing the style of each list.
